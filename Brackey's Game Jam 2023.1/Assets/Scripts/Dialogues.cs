 Welcome to the game Player, It seems really lonely here. Just you and your mere body. I know that feeling, and I guess you know it too. 

 Oh, you can't see anything, right? Don't panic but, here are your eyes... There you go. Now it's less lonely.

 Did you try moving? The code might now work right now. Let me tell the developers to restart. Ok, now you can move with pressing A or D.

 - Good

 Those lazy developers also forgot to give you your jumping ability. Wait a second, alright done. Press Space to jump. You can hold it to go a little higher. And you can also do a wall jump.

 Ok, look at least there are some more cool stuff. You can dash, press shift or x to dash.

 That weird looking oval is a portal. It teleports you to your next experi.. {experiment diyecekti} level. Yeah, new level. It takes you to a new level.
 
 As you can see, those red creatures will kill you (I know you got used to it {diye fısıldar}). Try avoiding them.

 - How did you even die there?

 - Umh, is this game that boring to make you go AFK.

 Nice, this hell (I meant the game {hızlıca}), is a lot more fun right now haha.

 You got the basics, good job. A lot faster than the previous one.
