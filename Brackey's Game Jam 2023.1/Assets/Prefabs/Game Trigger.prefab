  sentences:
  - Welcome to the game Player. It seems really lonely here.
  - Now it's just you and your mere body. I know that feeling, and I guess you know
    it too.
  - Oh, you can't see anything, right? Don't panic but, here are your eyes... There
    you go. Now it's less lonely.
  - Did you try moving? The code might now work right now. Let me tell the developers
    to restart. Ok, now you can move with pressing A or D.
  - Good
  - Those lazy developers also forgot to give you your jumping ability. Wait a second,
    alright done. Press Space to jump. You can hold it to go a little higher.
  - That weird looking circle is a portal. It teleports you to your next experi..
    I meant next level. Yeah, next level. It takes you to a new level.
